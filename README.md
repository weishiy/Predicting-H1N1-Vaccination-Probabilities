# Predicting H1N1 Vaccination Probabilities

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 vaccine based on their social, economic, demographic background, health behaviors, and opinions. The dataset used includes responses from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.

## Project Overview
Objective: Predict H1N1 vaccination probabilities.
Dataset: Train and test data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
Target Variable: h1n1_vaccine (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Features: Various binary and categorical features related to health behaviors, opinions, and demographics.

## Requirements
Evaluate models using AUC-ROC.
Explore the training dataset.
Test at least three machine learning models.
Optimize and evaluate the selected model (Model A).
Train and evaluate a new model with a subset of features (Model B).
Report performance metrics and plot ROC and PR curves for both models.
Include a discussion on findings, challenges, and future directions.
